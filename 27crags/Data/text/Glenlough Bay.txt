An Port and Glenlough
Glenlough
Glenlough is a breathtakingly beautiful bay in the most remote location on mainland Ireland.
It lives three kilometres north of An Port at the end of a winding 20km single track road and is
Ireland’s last great wilderness. Living along this coast are a huge collection of outrageous sea
stacks and very remote sea cliffs. This guidebook covers this outstanding rock climbing
location in Ireland's distant reaches.
For a more the guide to this entire area of coastline download the PDF
from www.uniqueascent.ie/sea_stack_guide.
To find An Port take the R230 Ardara road out of Glencolmcille Village for 500m and at a wee
bridge take the Port signposted road left. Follow this road for approximately 7 kilometre to a T
junction at Straboy. Take the left road and follow it for another 7 kilometre until you arrive at
the ocean.
 For all other rock climbing locations in Donegal visit Undiscovered Donegal.
Tormore Group
The southern end of Glenlough Bay is dominated by Tormore Island, at 148 metres high it is
Irelands highest sea stack.
ACCESS: From the An Port road end follow the cliff top path for approx 2KM until you are on
the headland overlooking these monster stacks. (Grid Reference G557906) For Cnoc Na
Mara and Lurking Fear descend the 200 metre grass slope to the lonely pebble beach facing
the stacks. Keep to the grassy slopes, directly above the beach and avoid the scree to your
right.

An Ascent of Lurking Fear Stack
ACCESS: Access to Tormore Island and The Hidden Stack is an involved affair! Follow the
access details as for Glenlough Bay stacks. Once on the beach, “coastaleer” your way West
along the high water mark to the channel facing The Hidden Stack. For Tormore Island there
is a further channel crossing to reach the non tidal platform at the bottom of the landward face
of Tormore. From car to base of route approx 3.5 hrs! An alternative approach is to paddle
form the storm beach as for Cnoc na Mara, this approach requires an uber calm sea.
Tormore Island VS, 220m
Grid Reference G556908 At 150m high is Ireland’s highest sea stack, this stack is the Daddy
of Donegal’s Sea stacks, it can be seen from Dungloe, approx 40 KM to the North East! This
route climbs the very obvious landward arete at the Eastern end of the island. This feature
can clearly be seen from any position along this coast overlooking the stack. Access to this
stack by land is a very involved affair a boat approach is recommended.
Descent is by 4 abseils back down this route using the block and peg belays described
Pitch 1. 45m Starting on the non tidal ledge in the centre of the landward face, directly
opposite the secret 35 mtr stack. Climb the blunt arete to the right of the vertical basalt vein,
follow the corners and ledges on superb quartz to a large block belay.
Pitch 2. 40m Continue up the arete on slabby mixed ground to a large ledge below the huge
capping roof, peg belay.
Pitch 3. 45m Climb direct on superb rock to the left end of the huge roofs and become
increasingly aware of your surroundings. Pass the roofs on the left and continue on mixed
ground to a huge ledge and peg belay.
Pitch 4. 45m Climb gearless, near vertical grass to an exposed wee ridge, follow the ridge for
15 metres to a block belay.
Pitch 5. 20m Scramble up the grass covered ridge to the summit.

Tormore Area from the south
Hidden Stack V.DIFF 42m
Grid Reference G556907. Hidden Stack sits in the channel separating "Tormore Island" and
"Cobblers Tower." Access is by a superb paddle from the storm beach as for "Cnoc na Mara."
This route climbs the Southern Ridge, the first feature on the stack you see as you paddle up
the channel towards it.
Pitch 1. 15m From the non tidal platform at the base of the South end, climb the up the left
side of the South facing ridge to a large ledge.
Pitch 2. 15m Continue up the ridge to a lonely huge Basalt boulder.
Pitch 3. 12m Scramble along the summit ridge. Abseil descent down the seaward face from

The sea around "Hidden Stack" are very tetchy indeed and require due nautical care.
A. Wainwright, I. Miller 13/10/10
Cobbler’s Tower Diff 130m
This is the huge tower between Hidden Stack and mainland Donegal, it requires a very calm
sea state and considerable nautical guile to stand on it’s summit.
Climb the north face of the tower, starting in a scalloped recess on the landward face. The
climbing is steep mixed ground leading to a very scary and exposed summit which you will
leave as quickly as you can

This exposed sea cliff sits on the northern tip of the smaller bay just to the north of Glenlough
Bay. Follow the same 3.5 KM coastal walk from An Port road end to the top of the headland
containing the End’s of the Earth Crag. From this headland looking north the crag sits at the
far seaward tip of the opposite side of the bay. Access by walking around the smaller bay to
the north for approx. for 500m with a steep section at the back of the bay onto the boulder
beach. Once on the rock platforms overlooking the crag descend by the slabs to the south
and round on the sea level platforms into the cave at the landward side of the crag. Low to
mid tide required.
