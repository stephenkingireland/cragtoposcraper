Pollnalong
This dolerite sea cliff on the western coast of the Rosguill Peninsula provides a goods day’s worth of
climbing.
From Carrickgart follow the L131 north through Downings and onto the Atlantic Drive (approx 3km
from Downings). Immediately after passing Croaghatur Hill on the seaward side there is a small
parking spot. Follow a rough track, cross a stream and then head south down the coast along the cliff
top. Pass two main inlets to reach a longwall facing south west across to excellent views of Sheep
Haven to Horn Head and Tory island.
The climbs are in five shallow bays described from North to South, i.e. from right to left when looking
out to sea. Abseil access and a calm sea are required to reach the sea level ledges just above the
high water mark.
