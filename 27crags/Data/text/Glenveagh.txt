Glenveagh
Directions: Access to Glenveagh is from the R254 Doocharry to Gartan road, there is a small roadside
parking place at Grid Ref B972158. From here simply follow the path down in the stunning
Glenveagh, after approx 1km the path becomes an untarred road which takes you the full length of
the Glen to the Castle and visitor centre. As you descend into the Glen the huge main cliff looms over
you on your left.
After following the road for 3 KM there is an unlocked bothy on the right beside the road. Cross the
stream by the stepping stones outside the bothy and make a KM long rising traverse to the base of
the cliff.

Outlying Crags
Left of the main crag is an impressive waterfall, falling in a series of steps for almost 200m. This
waterfall itself provides a very pleasant climb in drought conditions with a variety of grades depending
on the many options for an ascent. To the left of the waterfall, the valley steepens again and there is a
series of small outcrops. Only two routes have been recorded to date.

Terra Nova E1 4b, 5b 50m
Start just to the left of Bombs Away.

subsidiary corner. Continue up this, finishing on fine steep jugs to a spike and large friend belay.

over the initial bulge, continue up twin seams to the next bulge. Turn this on the right to a difficult
rounded finish.

Glen Lack
Almost directly across the bridle path at the fisherman’s hut at the lake, (Grid Ref C003188) follow
the wee path up the hill for approx. 1km. Stay on this path as you leave the forest and enter the open
uplands of Glen Lack. This crag is the large slab on the opposite side of the glen from the path. The
crag is a slab of excellent rock which unfortunately requires at least 5 days of dry weather to allow the
ground above the crag to dry out.
Wandering Aengus VS 72m
Start at the right side of the slab, just left of the vegetated crack with a holly tree in the centre of the
