Cruit Island.
Cruit is one of the only two islands off the Rosses which are still permanently inhabited, now joined to
the mainland of Donegal by a bridge at Belcruit near Kincasslagh. The Gaelic word Cruit can mean “a
small harp.”
Looking north from the summit of Albatross Zawn.
Looking south from the summit of Traderg Wall
The Climbing on Cruit is on a multitude of 10 to 15m immaculate sea wash granite sea cliffs. On
some of the more sheltered crags the rock contains huge very sharp crystals, all the crags provide
good to excellent climbing in beautiful surroundings.
It is possible to climb on Cruit in all tides and sea states. During high tide and a bouncing sea state
Albatross zawn, Green Gully, Farmhouse Crag, Wall of Winter Sun and The Outdoor Climbing Wall
provide the most sheltered crags.
On your first visit it is best to locate the Albatross Zawn at the opposite end of beach from the
Thatched Cottage Development. From the summit of this zawn it is possible to see most of the crags
on the island stretching out to the left and right of you as you face the sea.
Directions: From Crolly Village on the main Dungloe/Letterkenny road N56. Follow the sign post for
The Airport and continue on the R259 to the Viking House Hotel, turn down the wee road opposite the
hotel and take the left fork after 100m. Follow this road over the bridge onto Cruit Island. Once on the
island continue for a further 2km passing a grave yard on your left and a huge area of flat ground on
your right. At the end of the flat area the road bends to the right and goes up hill to the thatched
cottages, before this right hand bend take the wee sandy road to the left for approx. 100m to the left
end of a superb sandy beach. You are now at the Albatross zawn.

Albatross Zawn
Directions: This crag is a narrow west-facing zawn, south of the bay below the Donegal thatched
cottages development. It cannot be seen from the bay, you have to walk to the South end of the
sandy beach below the thatched cottages; or use the track on the left before the cottages
development - which requires sensible parking.

Aquamarine S 4a 22m
At the seaward end of the inlet is a wide crack just left of the overhang. Climb the arete on its right to

Black Eliminate VS/HVS 5a 10m
Climb the centre of the slab to the left of Slater Slot without using holds in either this or the thin
crack/weakness to the left. Thin at the start, then considerably easier. A couple of small wires were
used as side runners in the thin crack on the left to protect the initial moves above an ankle-snapping
ledge: without these the route would be serious (HVS) as the first runners are at the overlap.
L. Griffin, S. Hewitt 28/08/16

Outdoor Climbing Wall
Directions: This short wall is simply an outdoor climbing wall with perfect rock, holds and gear. It is in
a very shelter location and is unaffected by violent seas. Around high tide crag is "damp" the rest of
the time the sea is a distant memory. Approach as for "The Far West Buttress" and continue past this
crag for approx 250m, until stood on a flat area of bare rock facing out onto the rock islands. Descend
down either side of the crag.

Squeeze Zawn
This narrow zawn lies south of the Outdoor Climbing Wall, but before reaching the Amphitheatre.
Race Against the Tide V.Diff 10m
A lovely slab route at the grade. Scramble down the narrow (often one metre-wide) zawn to the
seaward (tidal) end. Left of a prominent left-slanting crack is a tapered slab. Climb large flakes steeply
onto the slab and continue up its centre to the top.
L. Griffin, S. Hewitt 18/08/16

Climbs the black slab on the opposite side of the zawn to, and just before the start of, Race Against
the Tide. From sea level climb easily up left-trending flakes to near the top, where it is possible to
escape right (D), or, better, move out left to a slabby, rounded and slightly furry finish.
S. Hewitt, L. Griffin, 24/08/16
The Amphitheatre
This is the open boulder-filled cove immediately south of Squeeze Zawn. It is almost non tidal, but the
back wall does seep after rain.
Muscle Spasm VS 4b 9m
The obvious line in the back wall takes the slightly-impending central dyke. This is more eroded than
the surrounding granite and gives good, strenuous moves on fine sculptured holds.
L. Griffin, S. Hewitt 24/08/16
Lost Wall
Directions: Approach as for "The Far West Buttress" and “The Outdoor Climbing Wall,” continue for
another 250m along the coast to the highest point on this coastline. Descent is easiest by scramble
down the steps at the Northern end of the crag to sea level. Low to Mid tide and calm seas required.

Climb the deep chimney at the land ward end of the south face, pulling out left and follow the left
trending crack to the summit.
I. Miller, W. Schuessler 24/03/11
Lost Wall
At the landward end of the south face but rather further right than Chipper Chimney. The following two
climbs lie either side of a prominent narrow pillar with a conspicuous "Sword of Damocles" fang at
around two-thirds height. The common start can probably be reached from the zawn at lowish tides;
otherwise it needs an abseil.
The Squeeze S 10m
This area of rock suffers seepage from the grass slopes above. Climb steps and easy ground to the
base of the overhanging chimney/slot, then grunt upwards to a leftward exit.
L. Griffin 18/08/16

Easy Peeler Diff 9m
At the seaward end of the wall climb the steep, blocky, and slightly loose fault line, ignoring the easy
finish by moving out right over a fine flake to the top of the arête.
S. Hewitt, L. Griffin, 15/08/16
Valencia Late HVS 5a 9m
Climb the first section of Easy Peeler and then move right onto the arête (a direct start up the steep
lower wall is perfectly feasible but involves a moderately bold move onto the slab above]. From a
position on the right side of the arête, move up to the left-slanting crack and climb it awkwardly, but
with excellent protection, to good finishing holds.
L. Griffin, S. Hewitt, 15/08/16
Seville V.Diff 8m
Starting immediately right of the large niche, climb the steep cracked slab, trending left towards the
top.
L. Griffin, S. Hewitt, 15/08/16

Traderg Wall Area
Directions: The South facing walls on the northern-end of Traderg Bay (GR 732210), which is found
behind and below the 'Donegal Thatched Cottage Development.”
Viewed from the beach below the cottages, the most obvious features are a narrow chimney,
'Chimney Sweep' with a bulbous wedge shaped cliff on it's left, which are accessed by a rightward
trending descent gully with a small stream in it, further again to the left. The following crags are listed
running from their northern end back south for 250m towards the Thatched Cottage Development.

Metal Wall
The right hand side of Tráthnóna Wall is steep and undercut and an abseil approach is the only

Western End
Aughnish Point
Identical to the granite at the Traderg Wall and nearby zawns, the rock is slightly steeper and some
care needs to be taken as the rock is quite friable in places.
Approach: Take the second turn left off the main road after the graveyard, follow this road until your
car can’t go any further then walk along the track until you reach a secluded cove. From here take the
obvious path to the very end of the peninsula where you reach a beach. The crag (south facing) can
be seen a further 200m beyond the beach.
The wall is roughly 50m long, up to 15m high and is separated by a narrow sea inlet at its base. The
"Manchurian Reprobate" takes the obvious left facing corner in the middle of the crag. Approach for
routes via abseil at high tide or a low tide boulder hop.
